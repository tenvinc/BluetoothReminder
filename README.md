## Description

It is very common for people to misplace things. To alleviate this problem, there are bluetooth trackers to be attached to things you want to keep track of. However, these trackers are often rather expensive
but come with many features. Thus, the aim of this project is to create DIY bluetooth trackers which are cheap and easy to use, albeit more limited in functionality.
Bluetooth Reminder is an app that communicates with these DIY beacons and triggers a notification whenever these beacons go out of range.

## How To Use

#### Installation

Go to Git releases and download the apk file on your corresponding Android devices. When prompted, press install.
Upon launch of the app, you should see a page with 2 buttons with a gear icon on the top right corner.

The gear icon when clicked will lead to the settings page where you can customise the scan settings.

The first button, __"SCAN FOR NEW BEACONS"__, will lead you to a page which shows all iBeacons in range.
To add a beacon to tracked, click on it and enter your desired name. After a few seconds, you should see that beacon disappear from the list, signifying that it has been added.
Each beacon also has a distance associated to it which can be used to distinguish beacons.

The second button, __"SEE TRACKED BEACONS"__, allows you to manage your tracked beacons, adding, removing, editting their names and turning them on or off.
When the tracked beacon is turned off, it will no longer trigger any notifications.

## API Reference

AltBeacon API is used to manage the beacons. For more information, please visit [AltBeacon](https://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/javadoc/reference/org/altbeacon/beacon/BeaconManager.html)
The beacon protocol used in this app is iBeacon. There are many beacon protocols out there and you can change the beacon protocol in the following code excerpt.

```java
    private static final String IBEACON_LAYOUT = "m:2-3=0215,i:4-19,i:20-21,i:22-23,p:24-24";
```

```java
    beaconManager.getBeaconParsers().add(new BeaconParser().setBeaconLayout(IBEACON_LAYOUT));
```
